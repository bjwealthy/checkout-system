# Checkout System

Please complete the following exercise. Don't read ahead. At each stage build the simplest implementation which meets the requirement.  Rather than looking stuff up, feel free to ask your partner for help.



## **Step 1: Shopping cart**

You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.  

```
Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
```

Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost

```
For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05
```

Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input


## **Step 2: Simple offers**

The shop decides to introduce two new offers

```
Buy one, get one free on Apples

3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
```

Update your checkout functions accordingly


## **Step 3: More complicated offers**

The shop adds Bananas which cost 20p

```
Bananas are added to the same buy one, get one free offer as apples
```

The cheapest item should be given free first

Update your checkout


## **Step 4: Even more complicated offers**

The shop adds melons which cost £1

```
Melons are available through a separate 3 for 2 offer
```

Update your checkout



## **Step 5: Real time checkout**

Customers complain that they do not know how much their shopping costs until all produce are scanned

Re-implement your checkout to show a running total as items are scanned.



## **Stretch Goal: Cheapest baskets**

Customers notice that they could save money by making multiple trips to the checkout.  Why?

Update the checkout so that customers get the lower price for only one trip
